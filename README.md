🚀 4 Months Before Uni – Reflection on My Cyber Journey So Far

With my foundation degree in cyber security starting soon, I’ve been thinking about what I’ve managed to achieve in the past few months. Rather than just waiting for the course to begin, I wanted to use this time to build a strong foundation and prove to myself that I’m ready for the challenge ahead.

Here’s what I’ve accomplished so far:

🎓 Certifications & Courses

Cisco Networking

Cisco Cyber Security

Cisco Python

PCEP (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer)

TryHackMe Jr Pentester Certificate

TryHackMe Pre Security Certificate

🛡️ Practical Experience

55-day streak on TryHackMe

🤝 Professional Outreach

Soon to be on the South West Cyber Crime Unit newsletter, with potential placement opportunities in their forensics team

It’s been an incredible journey already, and I’ve loved every second of the learning. The more I study and practice, the more I feel this is exactly where I’m meant to be.
