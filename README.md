With my foundation degree in cyber security starting soon! I’ve been thinking about what I’ve managed to achieve in the past few months. Rather than just waiting for the course to begin, I wanted to use this time to build a strong foundation and prove to myself that I’m ready for the challenge ahead.

Here’s what I’ve accomplished so far:



🎓 Certifications & Courses

Cisco Networking

Cisco Cyber Security

Cisco Python

PCEP (Certified Entry-Level Python Programmer)

TryHackMe Jr Pentester Certificate

TryHackMe Pre Security Certificate



🛡️ Practical Experience

55-day streak on TryHackMe

Top 8% globally (Rank: ~135,000)

68 rooms completed

12 badges earned



🤝 Professional Outreach

Reached out to local IT companies near me with positive work / cyber project opportunities. 

Reached out to the South West Cyber Crime Unit, with potential future opportunities / placements. 



It’s been an incredible journey already, and I’ve loved every second of the learning. The more I study and practice, the more I feel this is exactly where I’m meant to be.

This is just the beginning I can’t wait to see what the next chapter brings when my degree starts.
